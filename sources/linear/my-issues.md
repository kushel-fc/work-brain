# Linear — my issues

Assigned to Kushel, live (non-completed) statuses. Populated on sync — completed/canceled work stays in Linear's own history rather than being repeated here; see `git log` for what rolled off.

**10-07 sync:** No change, still 4. Nothing new assigned and none of the four moved. BDD-3223 (Done) got an `updated` bump 10-06 13:31 UTC when his follow-up product-service#2866 linked to it. BDD-3213 (Slice 5) still has no update since it started 10-01. BDD-2258 (High) is still Ready To Start, untouched since 08-18.

Assigned 10-01. Video Delivery project, Slice 5 milestone, created by Irem Bulut 09-03 and started 10-01 08:41 UTC. No update since. Scope: one audit entry per download (not per video) plus a separate per-SKU download-counts collection, and observability (bytes delivered, build duration, failure rate). The ticket text says it can't start until N3 (where PCS's Mongo lives) is decided. That gate is now cleared: N3 (BDD-3193) has been Done since 09-29, though its ticket doesn't say which store was chosen. The ticket also lists Slice 2 as a dependency. It also asks for a decision first on whether the audit records intent (token creation) or delivery (bytes actually left), since that decides whether the backend has to report back.
